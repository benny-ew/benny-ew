I am an advanced PHP coder / Web developer and have been very strong with PHP and web programming for over 20 years, since 2000. I've been doing IT consulting and development for many years and have become worth pretty good at it. I already made my own framework before the famous ones like Symfony, Codeigniter, Laravel. Lately, I’ve been working on REST APIs building, with the latest of Laravel to work with and shaping both the OOP power of PHP and Vue. js or React front-end framework.

I am mostly a one-man-fits-all full-stack developer, doing docs/coding/testing by myself. I have learned how to use VMs and containers for development since 2015 (Vagrant and Docker, so whad'ya know).

I started employment in 2014 at a tech solution company as an Implementation Engineer and was on the ground with a dev team building solutions for multiple water supply companies in Indonesia. This team built out billing, customer service, network, data center solutions using C# MVC, and they manage their code in GitLab.

My own tech solution business, Simetris, I cofounded just at the end of 2019. But the pandemic affected us, it affected our growth, we had projects deferred. Consequently, I am on the look out for a new job.

This year I created a pattern for making business application using Laravel and VueJS or NextJS. This framework is based on the “Separation of Concerns” principle and has a number of layers, namely Controller, Service, Repository, and Model. It was built for co-op multiplayer/team development and the skeleton is on my github (benny-ew).
