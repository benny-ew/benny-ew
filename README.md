I am a highly experienced PHP programmer and web developer with 20 years of expertise, starting from the year 2000. Over the years, I have evolved into a skilled IT consultant and developer. Before the emergence of popular frameworks like Symfony, CodeIgniter, and Laravel, I had already created my own framework. Recently, I have focused on developing REST APIs using Laravel and leveraging the power of OOP in PHP, combined with Vue.js or React as a front-end framework.

My role has primarily been that of an all-round, single-player, full-stack developer, handling documentation, coding, and testing independently. Since 2015, I have incorporated the use of virtual machines and containers in my development process, gaining proficiency in Vagrant and Docker.

In 2014, I joined a technology solution company as an Implementation Engineer, working with a development team to create solutions for several Indonesian water supply companies. This team developed billing, customer service, network, and data center solutions, utilizing the C# MVC framework and managing code in GitLab.

In late 2019, I founded my own technology solution company, Simetris. However, the pandemic impacted our growth, leading to project postponements. As a result, I am currently seeking new job opportunities.

This year, I developed a new framework for building business applications using Laravel and VueJS or NextJS. This framework follows the “Separation of Concerns” principle and features several layers, including Controller, Service, Repository, and Model. The framework is designed for collaborative, multi-player team development and the skeleton of this framework is available on my GitHub (benny-ew).
