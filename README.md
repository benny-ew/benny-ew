I am a 20 years experienced PHP programmer and web developer since the year 2000 and have become an IT consultant and developer since then. I was creating my framework before the famous framework such as Symfony, CodeIgniter and Laravel were created.  But in recent years, I developed REST API using Laravel and maximize the power of OOP in PHP and vue as a front-end framework. 
 
I was mostly acting as an all-round, single player and full stack developer that prepares documents, codes, and tests all by myself. Since the year 2015, I also learn to use VM and containers in the development process, thus I learn vagrant and docker. 
 
In 2014 I joined a technology solution company as an implementation engineer. I worked with a development team and created solutions for several Indonesia water supply companies. This team developed billing, customer service, and other solutions, and also network and data center solutions. We use C# MVC framework as base code and the code was saved in our Gitlab server.

Actually I created my solution company, named Simetris, at the end of 2019. But this pandemic made my company unable to grow. All projects were postponed until now, so I have to look for  another job.
 
But this year,I created my own framework to build business apps with the usage of Laravel and VueJS. I like to implement the “separation of concern” principle, with several layers, that are controller, service, repository and model. Actually I created this framework in order to make the development could be conducted with a multi player team - not like i did. I put the skeleton of this framework on my github (benny-ew).
